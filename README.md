# BPC - DE1 - project - Ciphers on FPGA

## Topic 5: Implementation of Basic Ciphers

**Description:** 

This project aims to demonstrate various simple ciphers, such as the Vernam Cipher, Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and potentially others, using basic logic gates and flip-flops on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. Each cipher enabling users to input plaintext messages and observe the resulting ciphertext generated by the encryption process. Buttons and switches can serve as input devices for users to input plaintext messages and control the encryption/decryption process. LEDs can provide visual feedback on the status of the encryption/decryption process, indicating ready to receive input, encryption/decryption in progress, and complete. The 7-segment display shows the ciphertext or plaintext output.
